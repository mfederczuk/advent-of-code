Notes:

move N spaces (where N > 1), pause here, and go back to before these N spaces were moved
take the next possible way (that wasn't just moved towards) and continue here, again just moving N spaces

compare these two results; continue wherever is less risk, and queue the other to do after we're done with this new one


N = 5 seems to be a good number, which (in theory) should decrease the time taken for both the example- and the real
input by a significant margin
this number may need a bit of tweaking though
